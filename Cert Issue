SSL Handshake related exception:

Most likely certificate issue.
Check:
- if cert is expired: access targeted site, view cert from Inspect Element -> Security, and see validity dates
- if cert is missing in keystore (location configured on container (WebLogic -> instance -> keystore etc.))
- if cert is different than the one used on targeted site

Cert can be exported from webpage.
Use "keytool" to edit keystore and certs.

Servers need restart in order for updated keystores to take effect.

Can schedule scripts to monitor SSL cert for urls.
